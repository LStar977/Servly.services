Become a Servly Provider

Servly connects customers with trusted, verified, and professional service providers.
To keep our marketplace safe and reliable, we follow a simple and fair verification process — similar to Uber and DoorDash — while keeping onboarding fast and easy.

🔐 1. Identity Verification

To prevent fraud and ensure real professionals join the platform, all providers must confirm their identity.

Required (choose one):

Driver’s License

Passport

Provincial/State ID

✔ Only one valid photo ID is needed.

🏢 2. Business or Personal Provider Verification

Whether you're a registered business or a solo provider, we need basic proof that your service is legitimate.

You can provide either:

If you’re a registered business:

✔ Business registration number (BN, EIN, or state/provincial registration)
✔ Business name
✔ Business address

If you’re a solo provider (not a registered business):

✔ Your legal name
✔ Proof that you provide the service (portfolio, website, business socials)

✔ This ensures all providers are real and compliant — no fake listings.

🛠 3. Skills, Licensing, or Proof of Experience

We accept ALL types of professionals, from licensed trades to creative freelancers.
Just provide the type of proof that fits your service.

If your service requires a license:

(e.g., plumbing, electrical, HVAC, gas, locksmithing)

Provide one of:

Trade license

Red Seal certification (Canada)

State/Provincial trade license

If your service does NOT require a license:

(e.g., cleaning, beauty, photography, organizing, wellness)

Provide one of:

Portfolio or photos of previous work

Website or business social page

Google Business Profile

Client reviews from any platform

✔ We only require what makes sense for your category.

🏠 4. Background Check (In-Home Services Only)

If your service requires entering a customer’s home or handling personal items, a background check is required—just like Uber, TaskRabbit, and Amazon Home Services.

Required for:
✔ Cleaners
✔ Movers
✔ Handypeople
✔ In-home beauty/wellness
✔ Care providers
✔ Home organizers

Not required for:
– Lawn care
– Snow removal
– Car detailing
– Photography
– Beauty done at provider’s studio
– Tutors
– Consultants
– Outdoor labor

✔ We use a third-party service OR you can upload a recent screening.

🛡 5. Insurance (Only for High-Risk Categories)

Not everyone needs insurance.
Only certain higher-risk or regulated services must provide proof.

Required for categories like:

Plumbing

Electrical

HVAC

Appliance repair

Contracting / construction

Accepted:
✔ General liability insurance
✔ Workers’ compensation (if you have employees)

✔ Most providers do not need insurance unless required by law or risk level.

💳 6. Payment Setup

To receive payouts, providers must connect a secure payout account through Stripe Connect.

Required:
✔ Legal name or business name
✔ Bank account information
✔ Identity confirmation (handled by Stripe)

✔ This protects you from fraud and ensures you get paid on time.
