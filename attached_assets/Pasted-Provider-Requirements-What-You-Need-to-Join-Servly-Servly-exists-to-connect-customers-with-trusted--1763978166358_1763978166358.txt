Provider Requirements
What You Need to Join Servly

Servly exists to connect customers with trusted, professional, and verified service providers.
To keep our marketplace safe and high-quality, all providers must meet the following onboarding requirements.

✅ 1. Identity Verification

To prevent fraud and ensure only real professionals join the platform, all providers must complete a secure ID check.

Accepted forms of ID:

Driver’s License

Passport

Provincial/State ID

✅ 2. Business Verification

Servly only accepts legitimate service providers — whether you're a registered business or a licensed sole proprietor.

You'll need to provide:

Business registration number (BN, EIN, or State/Provincial registration)

Legal business name

Business address (must match registration)

Why this matters: It helps us confirm your business is real, compliant, and ready to serve customers.

✅ 3. Licenses or Certifications (Service-Specific)

Some categories require official credentials.
If applicable, you will need to upload:

Trade license (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, gas fitting, etc.)

Red Seal certification (Canada)

State/Provincial professional license

Cosmetology / esthetician certifications

Locksmith certification

Apprenticeship proof (for regulated trade helpers)

✅ 4. Insurance Requirements

For certain high-risk categories, we require proof of valid insurance.

Needed for categories such as:

Plumbing, electrical, HVAC

Appliance repair

Moving services

Construction / contracting

Wellness services (if required in your region)

Accepted insurance types:

General liability insurance

Workers’ compensation (if you have employees)

✅ 5. Background Check (In-Home Services)

If your service requires entering a customer’s home or handling personal items, a background check is required.

This includes:

Cleaners

Movers

Handypeople

Wellness/beauty providers

Care providers

We may use a third-party service (e.g., Certn, Checkr) or you can upload a recent screening.

✅ 6. Proof of Experience or Work Samples

To help customers trust your business, we require one of the following:

Website or business social media page

Google Business Profile

Portfolio or photos of previous work

Links to reviews from other platforms

This helps us verify the quality and authenticity of your services.

✅ 7. Payment Verification

To receive payouts, you must connect a verified payout account through Stripe Connect, our secure payment partner.

Stripe will ask for:

Legal business name

Bank account details

Identity confirmation

This protects you against fraud and ensures you get paid on time.
