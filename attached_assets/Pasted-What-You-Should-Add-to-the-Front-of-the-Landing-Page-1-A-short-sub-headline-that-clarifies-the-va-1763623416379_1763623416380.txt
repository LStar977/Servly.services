What You Should Add to the Front of the Landing Page
✅ 1. A short sub-headline that clarifies the value instantly

Right now the “Your world of services, simplified” is great, but you need one line under it that answers:
“What does Servly actually do?”

Something like:

Book trusted service pros instantly — and manage everything in one app.
From cleaning to car detailing, Servly handles it all for you.

or

One app for every service.
Smart matching, instant booking, transparent pricing.

This gives clarity in 2 seconds.

✅ 2. Social Proof Section (right under the hero)

This is HUGE for conversion.

Add:

⭐ Number of verified providers (“Over 1,200 verified providers across North America”)

⭐ Completed bookings (“50,000+ services completed on Servly”)

⭐ Average rating badges

Logos of well-known companies using the platform (even placeholders for now)

This instantly builds trust.

✅ 3. A Quick “How it Works” 3-Step Strip (simple icons)

Right under the hero section, add:

How Servly Works

1️⃣ Choose a service
2️⃣ Pick a time
3️⃣ We match you instantly

OR

1️⃣ Browse → 2️⃣ Book → 3️⃣ Done

This reduces friction for new users.

✅ 4. A big search bar

People LOVE search bars.
Example:

🔍 What service do you need today?

With placeholder text like:
“Cleaning, lawn care, car detailing…”

This increases engagement and makes it feel like a marketplace.

✅ 5. Highlight of AI Features (“Servly Assist”)

This differentiates you from HomeStars, Angi, etc.

A little card could say:

🤖 Meet Servly Assist

Ask anything and we’ll book it for you.
“Find me a car detailing at 3 PM today.”

—

This is your “wow” factor.

✅ 6. Preview of Service Providers (top-rated)

Show 2–3 sample providers with:

Their photo/logo

Rating

Short description

It gives users the Uber feel:
“Oh these are real local companies.”

✅ 7. Trust + Safety Guarantees

Add a tiny row of badges:

Background-checked providers

Secure payments

Satisfaction guarantee

Verified reviews

This increases conversions massively.

✅ 8. Benefits Section (for users)

Horizontal row of 3–4 blocks:

Instant Booking

Verified Providers

Transparent Pricing

All-in-One App

Clear, simple, effective.

🔥 9. “For Business” Teaser Box

Since you're hybrid (marketplace + SaaS), add a small card in the hero:

For Business

Grow with Servly Pro — get bookings, automation tools, and insights.
Learn More →

This immediately signals Servly is two-sided.

🔟 10. Add a small “Service Areas” section

If you want to showcase your reach:

📍 Proudly serving:
Toronto · Calgary · Vancouver · Chicago · Los Angeles (examples for now)

This makes the platform feel larger and legitimate.

⭐ BONUS: A background animation or subtle movement

For example:

Icons floating slightly

A subtle gradient glow behind the hero

Slow movement on the service card slider

This gives your landing page that “tech-startup” feel.
