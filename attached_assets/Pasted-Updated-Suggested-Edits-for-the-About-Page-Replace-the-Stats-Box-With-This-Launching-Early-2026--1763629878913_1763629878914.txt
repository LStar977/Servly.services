Our Story

Servly was created because finding reliable local services shouldn’t be this hard — and running a small service business shouldn’t feel impossible.

After working in customer service and helping manage a small family business, I experienced both sides of the problem:
the people who need help but don’t know who to trust, and the small business owners who provide great work but struggle to get consistent customers without expensive ads or complicated tools.

I saw how many everyday tasks still rely on phone tag, outdated directories, and guesswork. Meanwhile, large companies have access to automation, scheduling software, and marketing systems — tools most small businesses can’t afford.

Servly was built to bridge that gap.

We’re creating a platform where customers can book trusted professionals as easily as ordering a ride, and where small businesses get modern tools, visibility, and opportunity all in one place.

Servly isn’t just a marketplace. It’s a movement to make work easier, faster, and fairer for everyone.

🎨 How This Should Look on the Page
1. Main About Hero — unchanged

✔ Perfect as-is.

2. Mission + Vision — updated (optional clean version)

I can rewrite if you want.

3. New “Launch Status” box

Placed where the 10k/500+/4.9 box used to be.

4. Story — replaced with the updated one

Short, powerful, founder-led, and aligned with the timeline.

5. CTA Section (Join the Movement) — update wording slightly

Change:

Find Services → Join Waitlist
Join as Provider stays the same.

This aligns with “launching soon.”
