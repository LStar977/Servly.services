Here’s a prompt you can paste straight into Replit’s AI builder to have it generate the **actual Servly product**, not just a landing page:

---

**Prompt for Replit AI: Build the Servly product**

Build a full-stack web app called **Servly**.

Servly is a platform that lets people **find and book trusted local services**, and lets **small service businesses** manage bookings, schedules, and customers in one place.

Use the following landing page as the conceptual and content reference:

* Title/brand: **Servly**
* Tagline: “Services, simplified” and “Find and book trusted local services.”
* Positioning: Servly makes it easy for people to discover and book verified local providers, and gives small businesses tools to run with the polish of a large company.
* It targets:

  * **For individuals**: booking cleaning, repairs, moving, beauty, automotive, etc., without a mess of texts or calls.
  * **For businesses**: a modern booking system instead of scattered DMs and calendars.
* Example service categories:

  * Automotive Services
  * Home Cleaning
  * Handyman & Repairs
  * Plumbing & Electrical
  * HVAC & Heating/Cooling
  * Landscaping & Lawn Care
  * Moving & Delivery
  * Beauty & Wellness
  * More Services (pet care, tutoring, errands, etc.)

I want you to turn this into a **real product MVP**, with separate flows for **customers** and **providers**, plus a simple **admin** view.

### Tech stack

* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (you can use Next.js or Vite + React, your choice).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express or Next.js API routes.
* **Database:** SQLite (via Prisma or another simple ORM).
* Add a clear `README.md` explaining how to run the project on Replit.

---

### Core Concepts & Roles

1. **Users**

   * A user can be:

     * **Customer** (booking services).
     * **Provider** (offering services).
     * **Admin** (internal role).

2. **Service Categories & Services**

   * Categories (see list above).
   * Each Provider can attach themselves to one or more categories and define specific **services** (e.g., “1-bedroom deep clean”, “Oil change”, “Local move”).

3. **Bookings**

   * A Booking connects:

     * Customer
     * Provider
     * Category and specific service
     * Date, time, location, notes
     * Status (e.g., Pending, Accepted, Declined, Completed, Cancelled)

---

### Authentication & Onboarding

Implement **basic auth**:

* Email + password signup/login.
* Store hashed passwords.
* Role field on the user (customer/provider/admin).

**Customer onboarding:**

* After signup as **Customer**, ask for:

  * Name
  * Default location (city + postal/zip code)
  * Optional phone number

**Provider onboarding:**

* After signup as **Provider**, collect:

  * Business name
  * Contact name
  * Business email & phone
  * Service areas (city / area)
  * Categories they operate in (multi-select from the category list above)
  * Short description of the business
  * Base hourly rate or price notes
  * Availability (simple weekly schedule: e.g., available days + time ranges)

---

### Customer Experience (Web App)

Create a **Customer dashboard** with the same spirit as the landing page “Quick booking / customer view”.

Features:

1. **Browse & search providers**

   * Landing/search form with fields:

     * “What do you need?” (dropdown of categories)
     * Date
     * Time
     * Location (city/postal code)
   * When the user clicks **“See available providers”**, show a list of matching providers:

     * Provider name
     * Categories/services
     * Short description
     * Basic rating placeholder (you can hardcode or leave a field for the future)
     * “Request booking” button

2. **Booking flow**

   * Clicking “Request booking” opens a booking form:

     * Selected provider + category
     * Date and time (pre-filled from search but editable)
     * Exact address / area
     * Notes / description of the job
   * On submit:

     * Create a Booking with status **Pending**.
     * Show a success message: “Your booking request has been sent. The provider will confirm or decline.”

3. **Customer bookings page**

   * A page like “My bookings”:

     * List all bookings with:

       * Provider name
       * Category/service
       * Date & time
       * Status (Pending, Accepted, etc.)
     * Clicking a booking shows details (including notes and address).

---

### Provider Experience (Web App)

Create a **Provider dashboard** that matches the “For service businesses” messaging from the landing page.

Features:

1. **Provider profile**

   * A page where providers can:

     * Edit business info (name, description, contact info).
     * Choose service categories.
     * Add/edit specific services:

       * Service title
       * Short description
       * Price or pricing notes
     * Set basic availability (e.g., days of the week + time ranges).

2. **Booking requests**

   * List all bookings where this provider is the selected provider.
   * For each booking:

     * Customer name (or anonymized if you prefer)
     * Date & time
     * Service/category
     * Location area
     * Notes
     * Status
   * Provider can:

     * **Accept** or **Decline** a Pending booking.
     * Mark Accepted bookings as **Completed**.
   * When status changes, update it in the database so the customer sees updated status.

3. **Schedule / calendar view (simple)**

   * A simple list grouped by date:

     * Today, upcoming this week, and all future bookings.
   * It doesn’t need a full calendar component; a list view by date is enough for MVP.

---

### Admin / Internal View

Create a minimal **Admin page** (web-based) for internal use (accessible only to users with role `admin`):

* List all users with basic fields:

  * ID, name, email, role, created date.
* List all providers with:

  * Business name, categories, active/inactive toggle.
* List all bookings:

  * Filter by status (Pending, Accepted, Completed, Cancelled).
* Admin should be able to:

  * Change a user’s role (e.g., upgrade to provider or admin).
  * Deactivate a provider (e.g., an “active” boolean that hides them from search).

---

### UX & UI Notes

* Use the **branding and language** from the landing page:

  * Headings like:

    * “Servly – Services, simplified.”
    * “Find and book trusted local services.”
  * Sections explaining:

    * How it works for individuals: pick a service → compare providers → book & relax.
    * How it works for businesses: join Servly → get booked → grow like a big brand.
* Include a **top navigation bar** with:

  * Logo/title “Servly”
  * Links: “How it works”, “Services”, “For businesses”, “Log in”, “Join as a provider”
* Make the app **responsive** and clean, with Tailwind CSS.
* For now, **no payment integration** is required. Just focus on booking and management.

---

### Database schema (guidance)

Use an ORM like Prisma with SQLite. Suggested models:

* **User**

  * id
  * name
  * email (unique)
  * passwordHash
  * role (`customer` | `provider` | `admin`)
  * createdAt

* **ProviderProfile**

  * id
  * userId (FK to User)
  * businessName
  * description
  * phone
  * city
  * serviceAreas (string or JSON)
  * isActive (boolean)

* **ServiceCategory**

  * id
  * name (e.g., “Home Cleaning”)
  * slug

* **Service**

  * id
  * providerId (FK)
  * categoryId (FK)
  * title
  * description
  * priceNote

* **Booking**

  * id
  * customerId (FK to User)
  * providerId (FK to ProviderProfile)
  * serviceId (FK to Service)
  * categoryId (FK)
  * dateTime
  * address
  * notes
  * status (enum: Pending, Accepted, Declined, Completed, Cancelled)
  * createdAt
  * updatedAt

* **ProviderAvailability** (optional/simple)

  * id
  * providerId
  * dayOfWeek (0–6)
  * startTime (string, e.g. “09:00”)
  * endTime (string, e.g. “17:00”)

You can simplify if needed, but keep the core relationships: users, providers, services, bookings.

---

### Final goal

Deliver a **working Servly MVP** that:

* Lets customers sign up, search for providers by category/location, and request bookings.
* Lets providers sign up, create a profile, define services, and accept/decline/manage bookings.
* Provides an admin view to oversee users, providers, and bookings.
* Uses the copy, categories, and structure inspired by the existing Servly landing page, but as a real functional product.

---

If you need to simplify anything to make this build clean and maintainable, do so—but keep the core flows for **customers booking services** and **providers managing bookings** fully working.
