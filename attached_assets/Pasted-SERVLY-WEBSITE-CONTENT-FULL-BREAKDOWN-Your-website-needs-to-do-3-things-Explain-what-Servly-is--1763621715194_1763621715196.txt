SERVLY WEBSITE CONTENT — FULL BREAKDOWN

Your website needs to do 3 things:

Explain what Servly is (fast).

Make customers want to book.

Make businesses want to join.

So your site will have 6 main sections:

🏠 1. HOME PAGE

This is the MOST important page. It needs to instantly tell people:

What Servly does

Why they should care

How to start

Hero Headline

A bold sentence at the top.
Purpose: Tell people what Servly does in ONE line.

Example:

“Your world of services, simplified.”

This sets the tone — clean, modern, effortless.

Subheadline

Explains the headline in a bit more detail.

Example:

“Book trusted local professionals in minutes — from cleaning to car detailing.”

This makes the user think:
“Oh! It’s like a one-stop booking app.”

Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons

You need TWO main buttons:

✔️ “Find Services Near You” → For customers
✔️ “Join as a Provider” → For businesses

These buttons should be BIG and at the top of the page.

Visuals

A clean grid of categories with icons or images:

Cleaning

Lawn Care

Auto Detailing

Pet Services

Snow Removal

Users should immediately see what services you offer.

📲 2. HOW IT WORKS PAGE

This page explains your process simply using visuals or steps.

For Customers (Example)

Step 1: Choose a Service
Step 2: Pick a Time
Step 3: Get Matched Instantly
Step 4: Pay Securely in-App
Step 5: Service Completed → Leave Review

Add clean icons or illustrations above each step.

For Providers (Example)

Step 1: Create Business Profile
Step 2: Set Availability & Pricing
Step 3: Receive Bookings
Step 4: Get Paid Automatically
Step 5: Upgrade to Servly Pro

Demo Video or Animation

If you ever make a screen recording of your future app UI, you’ll put it here.

Purpose:
Let people SEE how Servly works in 30–60 seconds.

🧰 3. FOR BUSINESSES PAGE

This page sells companies on joining Servly.

Explain “Servly Pro”

Break down the benefits:

Automated scheduling

Customer management

Built-in payments

Business dashboard

Analytics

Repeat-booking reminders

Show Dashboard Screenshots

Even simple mockups are good (you can make them later).

Companies LOVE visuals — it makes them trust the platform.

Testimonials

Once you have providers, add quotes like:

“Servly helped us double our monthly bookings.”

Pricing Tiers

Example:

Free Plan: Accept jobs on the marketplace

Pro Plan: $99/month

(We can finalize this later.)

⚖️ 6. LEGAL PAGES
